                  <p>Splitter is a Java application designed to take a picture of a receipt, and split it into items for easier bill splitting between multiple people.
                    I worked on this with a small group of friends to solve a regular issue we encountered with splitting grocery bills. This app replaced our 
                    increasingly convoluted spreadsheets and was a fun project to work on.

                  <p>I developed a course parsing app alongside some classmates that scraped the University of Guelph's course and presented all course dependencies
                     and requirements in a connected graph using Electron.js. It fully supported the user to make custom views using a big data set and was aimed at optimizing 
                      course scheduling for students at the University of Guelph to graduate in as short a window as needed.

                  <p>I'm currently working on developing an app that will help crafty people keep tabs of their materials and completed tasks in an organized manner. 
                    I've been making it with my family in mind, as they felt it would be really helpful for all the sewing and crochet crafts that they've been working on.

                  <p>Using Web3, I made a specialty tool for a client that determined whether a user's connected wallet contained an NFT of select brand. I took on this task 
                    on both on commision and as an opportunity to look into some of the past excitement about blockchain development. I'm a curious person by nature, and think
                     it's crucial to understand emerging technologies, lest we slip into complacency.
